      <li>1/4 cup dry white wine (like Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc) <i>(optional)</i></li>

      <li>1/4 cup chicken or vegetable broth</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Cook the Pasta:</b> Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water before draining.</li>
      <li><b>Prepare the Shrimp:</b> While the pasta is cooking, pat the shrimp dry with paper towels. In a medium bowl, toss the shrimp with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper.</li>
      <li><b>SautÃ© the Shrimp:</b> Heat a large skillet or non-stick pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the seasoned shrimp in a single layer (you may need to do this in two batches to avoid overcrowding). Cook for 1-2 minutes per side, until pink and opaque. Remove the cooked shrimp from the skillet and set aside</li>
      <li><b>Make the Sauce:</b> In the same skillet, reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil, minced garlic, and red pepper flakes. SautÃ© for about 1 minute until fragrant, being careful not to burn the garlic.</li>
      <li><b>Deglaze and Simmer:</b> If using, pour in the white wine and let it simmer for 1-2 minutes, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Stir in the chicken or vegetable broth and lemon juice. Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer and let it reduce slightly for 2-3 minutes.</li>
      <li><b>Combine:</b> Add the cooked pasta to the skillet with the sauce. Toss well to coat. Add the reserved pasta cooking water, a little at a time, until the sauce reaches your desired consistency.</li>
      <li><b>Finish:</b> Stir in the cooked shrimp, fresh parsley, and the tablespoon of butter. Gently toss until everything is well combined and the butter has melted, creating a luscious sauce.</li>
      <li><b>Serve:</b> Transfer the pasta to serving plates. Garnish with extra fresh parsley and a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese, if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
