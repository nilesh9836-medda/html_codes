        <h1>Shadow Fight</h1>
        <p>Shadow Fight is a series of fighting video games developed by Banzai.Games and published by Nekki, set in a Far East-inspired world featuring martial arts combat between silhouetted fighters.
        The franchise began with the original Shadow Fight, a Facebook-based game released on February 12, 2011, which allowed players to engage in online battles using hand-to-hand combat, magic spells, and long-range weapons.
        The game was available in multiple languages, including English, Russian, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Turkish, but its servers were permanently shut down on September 29, 2017, with a delayed closure until October 27, 2017, due to player demand.</p>

            <h2>Shadow Fight 2</h2>
            <p>
                The series continued with Shadow Fight 2, released worldwide in 2014 for mobile devices and later ported to computers and eighth-generation consoles.
                This installment is more story-driven than its predecessor, following the journey of Shadow, a legendary warrior whose arrogance leads him to open the Gates of Shadows, unleashing demons and destroying his physical body, leaving him as a silhouette.
                Driven by redemption, Shadow seeks to reclaim demon seals, close the Gates of Shadows, and defeat the alien warlord Titan, who is revealed to be the creator of the Gates.
                The game features RPG elements, allowing players to upgrade armor, weapons, skills, and magical abilities, with characters depicted as silhouettes and animations based on realistic physics.

            The game incorporates action role-playing mechanics, with players collecting cards to acquire gear and unlock abilities based on their current faction and equipment.</p>
